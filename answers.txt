1.) Describe the functionality of server.c and client.c in <100 words:
    client.c connects to the server, reads the message 
    the server is sending and writes it to a file. Once the file
    has been read, the client disconnects.
    server.c reads a file to serve, accepts connections from
    clients and sends them the file via a stream. Once the file has 
    been send it closes the connection on the socket.

2.) Find and list three programming errors in the code
    server.c line 20: "if (argc != 2)" Should be "if (argc != 3)" as argc is 1+the number of arguments,
    and in this case there are 2.

    server.c line line 59 changed "int r,w;" to "int r=0, w=0;" as using the uninitialized int w later in the code can have undefined behaviour 
    
    server.c line 77: Missing closing bracket of main function

3.)
The browser receives what it thinks is an IP request, but is instead a plaintext file that it cannot decode.
