1.) Describe the functionality of server.c and client.c in <100 words:
    client.c connects to the server, reads the message 
    the server is sending and writes it to a file. Once the file
    has been read, the client disconnects.
    server.c reads a file to serve, accepts connections from
    clients and sends them the file via a stream. Once the file has 
    been send it closes the connection on the socket.
